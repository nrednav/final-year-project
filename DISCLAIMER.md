The code found within this project was developed as part of a final year project with the goal of only creating a *proof of concept* platform. As such, none of this code is ready for a production based environment and should not be treated as such.

You are free to download and use the platform, however please do so at your own risk. I will not be held responsible for any misuse or damage that may arise from your usage of this code.
